# sv modules

this repo culminates the system verilog code i've written used and found useful over the years to find the best practices and gotchas.
consists of mostly simple modules that does one thing

## todo

- [ ] finish with 0110 (systemverilog) and 1010 (verilog) sequence detectors
- [ ] find out other state machine types and implement a testbench for the sequence detector
- [ ] cleanup maxpooling code and implement and document it as a proper module

## conventions used in this repo

- usual module name = file name conventions are followed
- testbenches are named modulename_tb and kept in the same directory as the module
- all inputs and outputs must be mentioned separately and type defined, makes it easier for writing documentation too
